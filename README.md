# Framework
WordPress theme with support for multiple Header/Footer files. Uses a system similar to Page Templates and allows them to be hot-swapped from the Customizer.

This is meant to be cloned directly into `/wp-content/themes`. The `.gitignore` is set up in such a way that it won't attempt to track anything else in that directory outside of the Parent and Child themes.
